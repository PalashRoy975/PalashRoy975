Thanks for visiting!


I am Palash Roy. I have completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) and Masters of Science (M.Sc.) degrees in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [University of Dhaka (DU)](https://www.du.ac.bd/), Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2019 and 2021, respectively. Now, I am working as a Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in [Green University of Bangladesh (GUB)](https://green.edu.bd/). My research interests include, but are not limited to, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and edge Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), Optimal Resource Allocation, and Reinforcement Learning.
